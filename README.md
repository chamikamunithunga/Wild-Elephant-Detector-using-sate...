**Project Name** is a Python-based application designed to leverage the power of mapping, geolocation, and web development. The project integrates several popular Python libraries, including `folium` for interactive maps, `geopy` for geolocation services, `flask` for creating a web application, and `requests` for handling HTTP requests.

The main objective of this project is to provide users with a seamless way to visualize geospatial data on interactive maps, perform location-based services, and interact with a backend API. It is built to be both flexible and scalable, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from personal projects to large-scale enterprise solutions.

### Satellite Data Sources:

- NASA Worldview (EOSDIS) – Offers near real-time satellite data for observation.

- Sentinel Hub – Provides access to Sentinel satellite imagery and analysis tools.

- Google Earth Engine – A powerful tool for accessing satellite imagery and analyzing geospatial data.

- USGS Earth Explorer – Provides access to Landsat and other satellite imagery datasets.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Maps**: Visualize locations and geospatial data using `folium`.
- **Geolocation Services**: Use `geopy` to get geolocation information based on addresses or coordinates.
- **Web Application**: Utilize `flask` to create a simple web interface for users to interact with the app.
- **HTTP Requests**: Use `requests` to interact with external APIs or to gather data from web services.

### Target Audience:
This project is ideal for developers interested in geospatial analysis, web development, or creating location-based services. It can also be extended for use in real-time tracking applications, location-based analytics, and more.

With an easy-to-use interface and powerful functionality, **Project Name** is a versatile tool for developers and businesses seeking to integrate mapping and location features into their applications.
